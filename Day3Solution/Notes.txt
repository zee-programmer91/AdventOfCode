											Day 3: Rucksack Reorganization
											==============================

Loading all of the rucksacks with supplies for the jungle journey.

Rucksack:
	-	2 large compartments.
	-	All items of a given type are meant to go into exactly "one of the two"" compartments.
	-	Each rucksack is given as characters all on a single line.
	-	A rucksack always has the same number of items in each of its two compartments (half-half)

Find error(s) on the given items.

Item:
	-	Every item type is identified by a lowercase or uppercase letter.
	-	every item type can be converted to a priority:
		=>	Lowercase item types a through z have priorities 1 through 26.
		=>	Uppercase item types A through Z have priorities 27 through 52.

=================
Problem Statement
=================

Find the item type that appears in both compartments of each rucksack.
What is the sum of the priorities of those item types?


Implementation
==============

- Create Rucksack object
  => Compartment1 (vector)
  => Compartment2 (vector)

- Create Item object
  => value (char)

									TODO:

- Read items from a file (each line represents items in the rucksack)													[X]

- Save the items in a vector and save that vector in a map (to map each rucksack)							[X]

- Check which items repeat in the compartments of each rucksack (save them in a vector)				[X]

- Change the items you found repeating into prioriries (integers) and save them in a vector		[X]

- Add those numbers together to get the sum of those priorities																[X]


PART 2
======

For safety
	-	Elves are divided into groups of 3.
	-	Every elf carries a "badge" that identifies which group they belong to.
